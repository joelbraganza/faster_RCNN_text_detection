# faster_RCNN_text_detection
Using Faster RCNN(Object-Detection-Algorith) over images to identify and localize text in them. 
The faster-RCNN algorithm uses region-proposal method built on selective-search and similarity clustering technique.
These region proposals are fed forward to a CNN to extract feature maps with thier respective bounding box co-ordinates to detect objects during inference and draw a bouding box over them.
